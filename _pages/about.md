I am currently a first year graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania in the Computer and Information Science department. My ongoing research in the Computer Science department at University of Pennsylvania is focused on leveraging Natural Language Processing to study how language use varies with depression. My research is being supervised by Professor [Lyle Ungar](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ungar/) and Professor [Sharath Chandra Guntuku](https://sharathg.cis.upenn.edu). Professor [Lyle Ungarâ€™s](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ungar/) research group develops explainable machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing methods for psychology and medical research.

Prior to joining the Master's program at Penn, I had worked in a collaborative environment between academia and corporate research for two years, during which I closely worked with some of the most experienced professors at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore - India and extremely skilled researchers at the Royal Dutch Shell Technology Centre across India, USA and Europe. My work included frequently interacting with chemical researchers and geologists at Shell, and drive the short term goals of the project based on their suggestions.


Research Interest
------
I am interested in developing cross-disciplinary deep learning solutions, in particular Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Robotics. During my Master's at Penn, I aim to fully use the resources to explore and work on applications in NLP domain and further work on systems that belong to the intersection of natural language and computer vision.
