Research Assistant in the Medical Image Processing (MIG) lab headed by Prof.[Phaneendra Yalavarthy](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/yalavarthy/) of the Computational Data Science department at IISc, Bangalore. My research was in collaboration with the Royal Dutch Shell Technology Centre, Bangalore - India

Research Overview
======

The MIG lab led by Prof.[Phaneendra Yalavarthy](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/yalavarthy/) mainly focusses on deep learning and computational methods in medical imaging, medical image processing (reconstruction/analysis), physiological signal processing, photoacoustic imaging, and diffuse optical imaging and closely related works. 

The Digital Rock and Image Analysis group in Shell Technology Centre, Bangalore develops and uses image processing techniques to study the microstructure of porous media and build physics models to accelerate research and development cycles for Shell businesses. Examples of the porous media systems include 2-D or 3-D images of rocks and catalyst pellets. They have active projects to develop capability in areas of image classification, segmentation, physics based modelling and image reconstruction for different imaging modalities.
