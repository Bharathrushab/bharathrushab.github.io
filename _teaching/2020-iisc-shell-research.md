Research Assistant in the Medical Image Processing (MIG) lab headed by Prof.[Phaneendra Yalavarthy](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/yalavarthy/) of the Computational Data Science department at IISc, Bangalore. My research was in collaboration with the Royal Dutch Shell Technology Centre, Bangalore - India

Research Overview
======

The MIG lab led by Prof.[Phaneendra Yalavarthy](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/yalavarthy/) mainly focusses on deep learning and computational methods in medical imaging, medical image processing (reconstruction/analysis), physiological signal processing, photoacoustic imaging, and diffuse optical imaging and closely related works. 

The Digital Rock and Image Analysis group in Shell Technology Centre, Bangalore develops and uses image processing techniques to study the microstructure of porous media and build physics models to accelerate research and development cycles for Shell businesses. Examples of the porous media systems include 2-D or 3-D images of rocks and catalyst pellets. They have active projects to develop capability in areas of image classification, segmentation, physics based modelling and image reconstruction for different imaging modalities. 

One of the aspiration of their program in catalysis domain is to be able to process Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images acquired at different tilt angles to obtain a three dimensional tomographic volume which can be further analysed for pore connectivity, catalyst active site distribution, detailed characterization and simulation. Three dimensional imaging of catalyst particles scanned at nm resolution would allow accurate analysis of active catalyst particles dispersion on support sites, reactant accessible surface area for reactions and connectivity of the porous support matrix. However, the tomographic reconstruction software available with commodity hardware generates subpar images which are inadequate for accurate analysis of the 3D volume generated. Our efforts were directed towards benchmarking multiple open source available softwares such as IMOD, ASTRA for the reference sample images generated internally and come up with a workable combination of tools and algorithms. The problem involved adequate alignment and reconstruction methods and was also being pursued internally.
